	<h1 style="color:white;">Who Am I?</h1>
	<h2> General Information</h2>
	<p style="color:white;">My name is Travis Lathan Mclaurin and I am 20 years old! I was born in Evans, Ga and have lived here my whole life. I graduated from Lakeside High School in 2017. During my time at Lakeside I was a 4 year varsity football player. I excelled not only on the field, but in the classroom as well. I made the all-region and all-county team both my junior and senior year, while maintaining good grades in numerous AP classes. I am now a 2nd year college student at Georgia Military College who is pursuing a degree in Computer Science!</p>
	<h2> Family Life</h2>
	<p style="color:white;">Family is very important to me and I always make sure that they know that. My dad is an accountant for Chase Bank in Jacksonville, FL and My mom is a successful insurance sells woman in Augusta, Ga. I grew up in a 1 parent house hold most of my life with two younger brothers, Jaden(18) and Bryson(9). They look up to me in a lot of ways so I try my best to not dissapoint them. Not only my immediate family, but extended family members also have always pushed me to be the best version of myself that I can be. They annoy me but I would not be where I am without my family.</p>
	<h2> Religous Views</h2>
	<p style="color:white;">Jesus Christ is my one and only savior. He has helped me make very important decisions as well as the simple choices I make every day! I would not be in the place that I am today without Jesus, so I make sure to give him all the glory!</p>
	<h2>Free Time Activities</h2>
	<p style="color:white;"> Don't get me wrong! I am very interested in learning about the technology that our world revolves around but in my spare time I like to get away from it. My whole life I have been passionate about sports so in my free time you can find me doing something that involves exactly that. I love playing sports as well as watching them on television. This love also helped to form the very competitive spirit that I have. Outside of athletics, I also really enjoy hanging with friends, watching netflix and traveling as much as possible!</p>
	<h2>My Favorites</h2>
	<h3>Favorite Sports Teams</h3>
	<p style="color:white;"> NFL:Jacksonville Jaguars; Nba:OKC Thunder; NCAAF; Georgia Bulldogs
	<h3> Favorite Foods</h3>
	<p style="color:white;"> Hot Wings, Fried Shrimp, Pineapple
	<h3> Favorite Movies</h3>

	<h2>What do I want to get out of this program? </h2>
	<p style="color:white;"> This bootcamp would be a great starting foundation for a CS major with no prior experience. Life for a 20 year old student trying to find work can be pretty tough sometimes. The competetion is always high when it comes to getting jobs in the field, and many companies prefer applicants with more experience. This course would truly be a blessing for me because it would help me to gain more hands on experience with coding and open up many doors for a young man trying to establish himself. I think that leaning to code would definitely help further my career after obtaining a degree in Computer Science. This bootcamp is a great starting point for me, and I am beyond excited to have this opportunity.</p>
